- 👋 Hi, I’m Chitra Dhir
- 👀 I’m interested in How AI can be a superhero and not a supervillain. ( healthcare breakthroughs, not robots taking over!).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning How to make machines understand us better and websites that feel like they have superpowers.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open-source projects that make a real difference and Crazy ideas that combine AI and web dev.
